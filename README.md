# PianoGame
Piano game to measure how habits formed vary with various factors such as instructions provided while learning, focus during learning, etc. Developing this game for Mr. Lucas Carden for study required for his PhD in Psychology.
## Idea
*The game has two versions which are designed to reinforce the user to learn a sequence of piano keys using different instructions. This helps us in analyzing the impact instructions have on a human mind while learning.*

`generateRandomPiano.py` - A python script used to generate a random sequence of piano keys for testing the user
